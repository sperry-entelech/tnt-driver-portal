- [x] Authentication service with driver profile integration
- [x] Database service layer for trips, drivers, vehicles
- [x] Real-time trip assignment system
- [x] Trip status update functionality
- [x] Mock data replaced with real database queries
- [x] Loading states and error handling
- [x] Mobile-first responsive design

## üìã Pre-Deployment Setup

### 1. Supabase Database Setup
- [ ] Create Supabase project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
- [ ] Run the SQL schema from `supabase-schema.sql` 
- [ ] Insert vehicle data for TNT fleet
- [ ] Create driver accounts in Supabase Auth
- [ ] Test Row Level Security policies

### 2. Environment Variables
Create `.env.local` file with:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key_here
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key_here
```

### 3. Driver Account Setup
For each TNT driver:
- [ ] Create account in Supabase Auth (email + temp password)
- [ ] Insert driver record in `drivers` table with matching UUID
- [ ] Send login credentials to driver
- [ ] Instruct to change password on first login

### 4. Test Data Setup
- [ ] Create sample trips for testing
- [ ] Assign some trips to drivers
- [ ] Leave some trips unassigned for notification testing
- [ ] Verify vehicle assignments work correctly

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### 1. Local Testing
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
- [ ] Test login with real driver accounts
- [ ] Test trip assignment acceptance/decline
- [ ] Test trip status updates
- [ ] Test real-time notifications
- [ ] Test on mobile devices

### 2. Vercel Deployment
- [ ] Push code to GitHub repository
- [ ] Connect repository to Vercel
- [ ] Add environment variables in Vercel dashboard
- [ ] Deploy and test production build
- [ ] Set up custom domain (optional): `drivers.tntlimousine.com`

### 3. Production Testing
- [ ] Test with real driver accounts
- [ ] Test trip assignment flow
- [ ] Test status updates
- [ ] Test on various mobile devices
- [ ] Test real-time features
- [ ] Test authentication persistence

## üîí Security Verification
- [ ] Row Level Security enabled on all tables
- [ ] Drivers can only see their own data
- [ ] Authentication required for all actions
- [ ] API keys properly configured
- [ ] HTTPS enabled (automatic with Vercel)

## üìä Monitoring Setup
- [ ] Monitor Supabase dashboard for errors
- [ ] Check Vercel deployment logs
- [ ] Set up basic uptime monitoring
- [ ] Test error handling scenarios

## üéØ Go-Live Process
1. [ ] Final testing with TNT drivers
2. [ ] Training session for drivers (if needed)
3. [ ] Gradual rollout to select drivers
4. [ ] Monitor for issues
5. [ ] Full rollout to all drivers

## üìû Support Information
- Supabase Dashboard: Monitor database and auth
- Vercel Dashboard: Monitor deployments and performance  
- Driver Support: Provide contact information for technical issues

## üîÑ Post-Launch Tasks
- [ ] Monitor driver adoption and usage
- [ ] Collect feedback for improvements
- [ ] Plan feature enhancements:
  - Push notifications
  - GPS tracking
  - Trip history reports
  - Driver performance metrics
  - Admin dashboard

## üêõ Troubleshooting
Common issues and solutions:
- **Login fails**: Check driver account exists in both Auth and drivers table
- **No trips showing**: Verify driver_id matches between auth and database
- **Notifications not working**: Check Supabase real-time setup
- **Images not loading**: Verify photo_url paths
