# TEMPORARY LOGIN BYPASS

Since we're having issues with email confirmation, I'll create a temporary login bypass for development.

## Quick Solutions:

### Option 1: Use any existing confirmed user
Try these emails if they exist and are confirmed:
- kory@tntlimousine.com
- testdriver@tntlimousine.com
- Any of the other driver emails from the database

### Option 2: Disable email confirmation temporarily
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard
2. Authentication â†’ Settings  
3. Turn off "Enable email confirmations"
4. Try signing up again with any email

### Option 3: Manual database approach
I can create a working login by directly modifying the auth users in the database.

### Option 4: Demo Mode
I can create a demo mode that bypasses authentication entirely for testing.

Which approach would you prefer?
